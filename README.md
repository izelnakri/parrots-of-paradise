# Parrots of Paradise

This is my [Base24](https://github.com/tinted-theming/base24) based custom color scheme that is ideal for programming,
text editing and reading terminal interfaces. It is optimized with the help of AI to be very readable and aesthetically
pleasing to human eye on both dark and light terminal backgrounds.

You can use the color scheme as a [NeoVim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) colorscheme or configure your entire
operating system with [nix](https://nixos.org/) & [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) to 
base all your UI elements from these 24 colors. All required files are provided here, and you can read below on how to 
implement it. 

You can find [flake.nix](https://github.com/izelnakri/parrots-of-paradise/blob/main/nix.flake) in this 
repository which imports & exposes the colorscheme object in nix, so one can rewrite the relevant system configuration 
files with these base colors when used in [Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager).
